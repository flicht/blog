# Hello There 

This is the first post I believe, and will serve as a a Readme in how to setup a hugo post. meta right.


# Writing a new post

It's pretty simple to start a new blog post. From your root folder (not sure that this is actually necessary) enter:

`hugo new post/my-post.md`

On the Hugo tutorial site it replaces `post` with `posts` above. A bit sloppy from the theme if you ask me. 

# Editing the post

The post starts off as a draft. You can see this at the top of the markdown file. It shows

```
---
title: blah
date: today's date
draft: true
---
```

I don't know what this top of the markdown file config file thing is called, but it is pretty self explanatory. 

I don't know all of the keywords that you can use. But as well as the three above (date and title are auto generated from the command), in the theme that I am using you can add `tags`
